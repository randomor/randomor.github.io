# My Work Stack

Here are all the tools and things that help me work, I'll update this as I go:
### Cursor
https://www.cursor.com/
I've used a number of code editors over the years, from Textmate to Sublime Text to Vim to Emacs to VS Code to Cursor. I use Cursor mainly because of it's extension compatibility with VS Code and it's excellent AI related features. It's rapidly iterating with new AI related features, which makes it delightful to use.

### Windsurf
It was the first editor to support agent mode, and it innovate at rapid pace and give Cursor a fair run for it's money. As a result, I'm constantly bouncing between the two.

### Tomito

I like the idea of segment my time as Pomodoro method (although I don't always practice it as sometimes I'll let time flow). And I lean towards minimalism if you haven't picked that up already. This is the best timer I've found so far on Mac.
