Education market will be the first market we will support. Here is our early adopter educator Mrs Williams could potentially use this: Mrs Williams teaches one 4th grade class every school year. She creates a new Space for her class at the start of the school year. She uses Google Classroom to assign course work. At the beginning of every week, she will create a topic, which will become a share link, so she can share the topic to the class via Google Classroom. This share link will expire in 14 days automatically. Anyone with the link can contribute to the discussion by posting the videos to the topic. For the first week of the class, her topic was: please share three interesting things you enjoy. All the students will be able to share and view others contributions. But there are also options to make the videos only viewable by Mrs Williams. 

Features are coming.

2. Comments
3. Browser extensions will be a first class entry point.
4. Screen recording will be natively supported.
5. Transcript generation

## Internal FAQ
1. What are some of the internal principles for building the platform?
	1. Minimalism: be very selective in the features we support
	2. Affordable and fast: use the most scalable technology for hosting our assets as well as maintaining development speed
	3. Be user inspired, but not user driven: be serious about both with systems and processes.
		1. actively embed with community, listen to their feedback, involve them in prioritization
		2. consider where we are expanding to, it could be beyond education.
	
2. How are we going to create the camera?
The first version we can just have a basic recorder. And then we can improve from there.

3. How are we planning to support video encoding?
One of the biggest cost could be encoding and distribution of these videos, we will solve it in two ways: videos automatically expire until the educator explicitly saves them, the more they save it, it will start costing them. 
We will also do more calculation of the cost: considering multiple dimensions: storage cost, encoding compute, distribution cost, UX, DX. 
We should be achieve this in an order of magnitude cheaper compared to Flip.

4. How are we going to market the users?
Facebook groups and reddit, and X. We will be creating dedicated social media accounts to deeply embed with the users.

5. What's the 5 year plan?
We are dedicated to education market, we could expand to school and districts. 

6. What about AI?
AI will only play a role in helping us deliver values. We will leverage it if it differentiate us while also deliver compelling value.
